# Classifying Music with Machine Learning
This is the final project which I submitted for PHYSICS 3G03: Introduction to Neural Networks and Machine Learning. I used K-means clustering to classify music into genres, and neural networks to predict the geographical origin of music.

Dataset:
Fang Zhou, Claire Q and Ross D. King. Predicting the Geographical Origin of Music, ICDM, 2014.
